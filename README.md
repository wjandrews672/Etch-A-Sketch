css grid layout using javascript to create a drawing template

Wow. This project had me seeking out tools I didn't know existed and truly showed me how important it is to be able to research, find the tools you need, and learn how to incorporate them into your project.

I learned about document fragments and appended all the div boxes I needed to the fragment so that I could append the completed fragment to the DOM rather than hundreds or thousands of individual divs.

I was hitting a road block with appending an empty div multiple times and ended up reading about the cloneNode() method. I used this handy little built in function to clone a new div as many times as needed to fill out the document fragment.
